Q1. What is AJAX?
--> Asynchronous Javascript and XML.
    It is not a programming language.
    It uses a combination of:
       i.  A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server).
       ii. Javascript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data).

Q2. What are the features of AJAX?
--> AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server
    behind the scenes.
    This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole
    page.

load() method: The load() method loads data from a server and puts the returned data into the
               selected element.
  $(selector).load(URL, data, callback);

Q3. How AJAX works?
--> The XMLHttpRequest object is used to exchange data with a server without refreshing any other
    content of the webpage.
    
    To send a request to a server, we use the open() and send() methods of the XMLHttpRequest 
    object:
      i. open(method, url, async) -- Specifies the type of request
            method - the type of request: GET or POST
            url    - the server (file) location
            async  - true (asynchronous) or false (synchronous)

     ii. send() -- sends the request to the server (used for GET) 

    AJAX - Server Response
    The readyState property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.

    The onreadyStateChange property defines a function to be executed when the readyState changes.

    The status property and the statusText property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest object.

    0: request not initialized
    1: server connection established
    2: request received
    3: processing request
    4: request finished and response is ready

Q4. How to use GET and POST methods using AJAX?
--> jQuery $.get() Method:
    $.get() method -- requests data from the server with an HTTP GET request.
    
    Syntax:
    $.get(URL, callback);
    The required URL parameter specifies the URL we wish to request.

    The optional callback parameter is the name of a function to be executed if the request succeeds.


    jQuery $.post() Method:
    The $.post() method -- requests data from the server using an HTTP POST request.

    Syntax:
    $.post(URL, data, callback);
    The required URL parameter specifies the URL we wish to request.

    The optional data parameter specifies some data to send along with the request.

    The optional callback parameter is thr name of a function to be executed if the request succeeds.


    Difference between GET and POST methods:
    GET method can be used for project purpose to fetch data faster, but the privacy is not hidden.
    POST method can be used if we want our project to be encrypted and secure.
